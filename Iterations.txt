Iterations of square mask
-------------------------

1. Filter pocket made of two pieces of material, pipecleaner nose wire in a pocket, 
   elastics have a channel. 

   Problems identified: too thick with the two pieces of material, filter pocket never gets used.

2. Changes: Removed filter pocket so mask is made from two pieces of material - outside and inside. 

   Problems identified: pipecleaner was losing its shape due to its ability to move around inside the filter pocket.

3. Changes: stitched pipecleaner down with the zigzag stitch across its entire length to fix it in place.

   Problems identified: elastic channel was not very convenient, both for production process, and user experience.

4. Changes: removed elastic channel - made 4 elastics instead, attached at the corners, and stiched the two pieces of material
   together around the square, leaving a small gap at top where the mask could be turned inside out. That same gap was then used to
   insert the pipecleaner.

   Problems identified: gap at the sides of mask - air is able to get in and out, so mask is not pressed against face.

5. Changes: made pleats deeper in order to shorten the sides of the mask, while keeping the length the same so that it could still extend
   when being worn. Made the stich securing the pleats closer inside the mask. These two changes ensured that the mask fit more snug on 
   the sides, and much less air was able to get in and out of the sides. The stich being closer to the inside allowed the sides to fold
   in a way that curved easier, and the sides being narrow helped with that as well. Bottom of chin also feels more secure.

Alternative versions at each iteration
------------------------------------

2. Made a one-layer more breathable version for my grandmother, per her request. No filter pocket or inside material, just the outside.

   Made a cloth-ties version for Sanya, as per her request. Took a lot longer, because of difficulty making the cloth ties.
