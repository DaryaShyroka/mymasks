# MyMasks
A repository containing the data associated with my homemade face masks.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, wearing a face-covering mask in indoor public spaces became a requirement. 
At first, single-use surgical masks were mostly worn, but those masks were uncomfortable and bad for the environment. Cloth masks became more prevalent, as they felt nicer on the face and could be washed after wearing. 

After seeing many people make their own masks, I decided to buy some material and try it out myself, to channel my creativity, create something practical for myself and my friends, and improve my sewing skills along the way. 

This repository contains some of the data related to my mask-making venture, including the materials used (summarized in materials.csv). 

The main data set is masks.csv, and it contains data about every mask I have ever made. 

Below are some definitions for terms used in the datasets, such as iteration numbers and production stages.
